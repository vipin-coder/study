<p style="font-family: 'Sen', sans-serif;">Chapter 2: Doctypes
Doctypes - short for 'document type' - help browsers to understand the version of HTML the document is written in
for better interpretability. Doctype declarations are not HTML tags and belong at the very top of a document. This
topic explains the structure and declaration of various doctypes in HTML.
Section 2.1: Adding the Doctype
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration should always be included at the top of the HTML document, before the <html> tag.
Version ≥ 5
See HTML 5 Doctype for details on the HTML 5 Doctype.
<!DOCTYPE html>
Section 2.2: HTML 5 Doctype
HTML5 is not based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), and therefore does not require a reference
to a DTD (Document Type Definition).
HTML 5 Doctype declaration:
<!DOCTYPE html>
Case Insensitivity
Per the W3.org HTML 5 DOCTYPE Spec:
A DOCTYPE must consist of the following components, in this order:
1. A string that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "<!DOCTYPE".
therefore the following DOCTYPEs are also valid:
<!doctype html>
<!dOCtyPe html>
<!DocTYpe html>
This SO article discusses the topic extensively: Uppercase or lowercase doctype?

Chapter 3: Headings
HTML provides not only plain paragraph tags, but six separate header tags to indicate headings of various sizes and
thicknesses. Enumerated as heading 1 through heading 6, heading 1 has the largest and thickest text while heading
6 is the smallest and thinnest, down to the paragraph level. This topic details proper usage of these tags.
Section 3.1: Using Headings
Headings can be used to describe the topic they precede and they are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. Headings
support all the global attributes.
<h1> defines the most important heading.
<h6> defines the least important heading.
Defining a heading:
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
Correct structure matters
Search engines and other user agents usually index page content based on heading elements, for example to
create a table of contents, so using the correct structure for headings is important.
In general, an article should have one h1 element for the main title followed by h2 subtitles – going down a layer if
necessary. If there are h1 elements on a higher level they shoudn't be used to describe any lower level content.
Example document (extra intendation to illustrate hierarchy):
<h1>Main title</h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
 <h2>Reasons</h2>
 <h3>Reason 1</h3>
 <p>Paragraph</p>
 <h3>Reason 2</h3>
 <p>Paragraph</p>
 <h2>In conclusion</h2>
 <p>Paragraph</p>

Chapter 4: Paragraphs
Column Column
<p> Defines a paragraph
<br> Inserts a single line break
<pre> Defines pre-formatted text
Paragraphs are the most basic HTML element. This topic explains and demonstrates the usage of the paragraph
element in HTML.
Section 4.1: HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
DisplayYou cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed:
 <p>This is another paragraph, extra spaces will be removed by browsers</p>

Chapter 5: Text Formatting
While most HTML tags are used to create elements, HTML also provides in-text formatting tags to apply specific
text-related styles to portions of text. This topic includes examples of HTML text formatting such as highlighting,
bolding, underlining, subscript, and stricken text.
Section 5.1: Highlighting
The <mark> element is new in HTML5 and is used to mark or highlight text in a document "due to its relevance in
another context".1
The most common example would be in the results of a search were the user has entered a search query and
results are shown highlighting the desired query.
<p>Here is some content from an article that contains the mark>searched query</mark>
that we are looking for. Highlighting the text will make it easier for the user to
find what they are looking for./p>
Output:
A common standard formatting is black text on a yellow background, but this can be changed with CSS.
Section 5.2: Bold, Italic, and Underline
Bold Text
To bold text, use the strong> or <
b> tags:
strong>Bold Text Here</strong>
or
<b>Bold Text Here</b>
What’s the difference? Semantics. <strong> is used to indicate that the text is fundamentally or semantically
important to the surrounding text, while <b> indicates no such importance and simply represents text that should
be bolded.
If you were to use <b> a text-to-speech program would not say the word(s) any differently than any of the other
words around it - you are simply drawing attention to them without adding any additional importance. By using
<strong>, though, the same program would want to speak those word(s) with a different tone of voice to convey
that the text is important in some way.
Italic Text
To italicize text, use the <em> or <i> tags:
GoalKicker.com – HTML5 Notes for Professionals 9
<em>Italicized Text Here</em>
or
<i>Italicized Text Here</i>
What’s the difference? Semantics. <em> is used to indicate that the text should have extra emphasis that should be
stressed, while <i> simply represents text which should be set off from the normal text around it.
For example, if you wanted to stress the action inside a sentence, one might do so by emphasizing it in italics via
<em>: "Would you just submit the edit already?"
But if you were identifying a book or newspaper that you would normally italicize stylistically, you would simply use
<i>: "I was forced to read Romeo and Juliet in high school.
Underlined Text
While the <u> element itself was deprecated in HTMl 4, it was reintroduced with alternate semantic meaning in
HTML 5 - to represent an unarticulated, non-textual annotation. You might use such a rendering to indicate
misspelled text on the page, or for a Chinese proper name mark.
<p>This paragraph contains some <u>mispelled</u> text.</p>
Section 5.3: Abbreviation
To mark some expression as an abbreviation, use <abbr> tag:
<p>I like to write abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTMLabbr>!</p>
If present, the title attribute is used to present the full description of such abbreviation.
Section 5.4: Inserted, Deleted, or Stricken
To mark text as inserted, use the <ins> tag:
<ins>New Text</ins>
To mark text as deleted, use the <del> tag:
<del>Deleted Text</del>
To strike through text, use the <s> tag:
<s>Struck-through text here</s>
Section 5.5: Superscript and Subscript
To offset text either upward or downward you can use the tags <sup> and <sub>.
To create superscript:
<sup>superscript here</sup>

Chapter 6: Anchors and Hyperlinks
Parameter Details
href
Specifies the destination address. It can be an absolute or relative URL, or the name of an anchor. An
absolute URL is the complete URL of a website like http://example.com/. A relative URL points to
another directory and/or document inside the same website, e.g. /about-us/ points to the directory
“about-us” inside the root directory (/). When pointing to another directory without explicitly specifying
the document, web servers typically return the document “index.html” inside that directory.
hreflang Specifies the language of the resource linked by the href attribute (which must be present with this
one). Use language values from BCP 47 for HTML5 and RFC 1766 for HTML 4.
rel Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document. For HTML5, the
values must be defined in the specification or registered in the Microformats wiki.
target
Specifies where to open the link, e.g. in a new tab or window. Possible values are _blank, _self,
_parent, _top, and framename (deprecated). Forcing such behaviour is not recommended since it
violates the control of the user over a website.
title
Specifies extra information about a link. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when
the cursor moves over the link. This attribute is not restricted to links, it can be used on almost all
HTML tags.
download
Specifies that the target will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink. The value of the
attribute will be the name of the downloaded file. There are no restrictions on allowed values, and the
browser will automatically detect the correct file extension and add it to the file (.img, .pdf, etc.). If the
value is omitted, the original filename is used.
Anchor tags are commonly used to link separate webpages, but they can also be used to link between different
places in a single document, often within table of contents or even launch external applications. This topic explains
the implementation and application of HTML anchor tags in various roles.
Section 6.1: Link to another site
This is the basic use of the <a> (anchor element) element:
<a href="http://example.com/">Link to example.com</a>
It creates a hyperlink, to the URL http://example.com/ as specified by the href (hypertext reference) attribute, with
the anchor text "Link to example.com". It would look something like the following:
</p>
</body>
</html>
